"""
Ideally TreeSitter would be a "dependency", see https://packagecontrol.io/docs/dependencies, but dependencies
can't interface with `sublime_plugin` directly. This means no commands and no event listeners. See
https://github.com/SublimeText/sublime_lib/issues/127#issuecomment-516397027.

This means plugins that "depend" on this one, i.e. that do `from sublime_tree_sitter import get_tree_dict`, need to be
loaded after this one, or they need to do `sublime_tree_sitter` imports after this plugin has loaded.

TreeSitter does the following:

- Installs Tree-sitter Python bindings, see https://github.com/tree-sitter/py-tree-sitter
    - Importable by other plugins with `import tree_sitter`
- Installs and builds Tree-sitter languages, e.g. https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python, based on settings
    - Also installs and updates languages on command
- Provides APIs for a bunch of stuff (see more in README)

It's easy to build Tree-sitter plugins on top of this one, for "structural" editing, selection, navigation, code
folding, symbol maps… See e.g. https://zed.dev/blog/syntax-aware-editing for ideas. It's performant and doesn't block
the main thread.

This plugin ships with language binaries bundled in `tree_sitter_languages`. If users want to clone their own language
repos and build their own binaries, they can set `python_path` to an external Python 3.8 executable. The Python that
ships with Sublime Text is not suitable for building language binaries:

- Calling `build_library` raises e.g. `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_sysconfigdata__darwin_darwin'`
- This module is built dynamically, and doesn't exist in Python bundled with Sublime Text

It has the following limitations:

- It doesn't support nested syntax trees, e.g. JS code in `<script>` tags in HTML docs
    - Ideas on how to do this: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Multiple-Languages.html
- It only supports source code encoded with ASCII / UTF-8 (Tree-sitter also supports UTF-16)
- Due to how syntax highlighting works in Sublime, it can't be used for syntax highlighting
    - See e.g. https://github.com/sublimehq/sublime_text/issues/817

    Under the hood, ST synchronously puts async callbacks onto a queue. It asynchronously handles them in FIFO order in
    a separate thread. All async callbacks are handled by the same thread. Sublime source code suggests this, testing
    with `time.sleep` confirms it. This ensures there are no races between "text change" events (almost always edit)
    and "load" (always parse).

    When a text change occurs, we get its buffer and its syntax, look up the tree and metadata, and update/create the
    tree as necessary. Every listener instance is bound to a buffer, so we know in which buffer text changes occur.

            Calling `get_view_text()` in `on_text_changed_async` doesn't always return view text right after the edit
            because it's async.

            So, we handle the text change event in the main UI thread, get the new view text right there, and queue up
            a "background job" with `set_timeout_async` to parse the new tree. This works because `set_timeout_async`
            uses the same queue as the other `_async` methods.

            Note that some language parsers are so slow they visibly affect UI thread performance. Setting a
            `debounce_ms` for these languages is recommended.
